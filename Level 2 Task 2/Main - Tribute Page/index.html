        <h4>
            <p>Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar ( 14 April 1891 – 6 December 1956) was an Indian jurist, economist, and social
                reformer who fought economic and social discrimination against the untouchables (now dalits) in India's
                Hindu society, and who later renounced Hinduism and inspired the Dalit Buddhist movement.
                Ambedkar served as chairman of the drafting committee of the Constitution of India, and Minister of Law
                and Justice in the first cabinet of Jawaharlal Nehru from 1947 to 1951.
                He is also referred to by the honorific Babasaheb.<br><br>
                Ambedkar was a prolific student, earning doctorates in economics from both Columbia University and the
                London School of Economics, gaining a reputation as a scholar for his research in law, economics and
                political science.In his early career, he was an economist, professor, and lawyer. His later life was
                marked by his political activities; he became involved in campaigning and negotiations for India's
                independence, publishing journals, advocating political rights and social freedom for Dalits, and
                contributing significantly to the establishment of the state of India. In 1956, he converted to
                Buddhism, initiating mass conversions of Dalits.

                <br>
                In 1990, the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award, was posthumously conferred on Ambedkar. The
                salutation Jai Bhim (lit. "Hail Bhim") used by followers honours him.</p>
